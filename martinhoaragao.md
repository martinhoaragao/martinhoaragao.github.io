Heyo!

So, it seems you've arrived on the dark side of the web!
Oh wait, is it just where you get information about me?
Bah, just a second, let me clean this up then.

As you could see, this is my tiny corner of the internet, as such I feel entitled to loosen up on the language.
I find it quite hard to both describe myself and what I do easily yet, in a few words, here goes:

+ Annoying
+ Curious
+ Dynamic
+ Engineer

To be honest, I'm only 100% sure on the first point, but certainly the most valuable is the third.
Despite being fairly young (clearly an understatement), I've successfully tried out a myriad of things, all of which enhanced what I do.

Although I don't intend to go into much detail about everything I truly identify myself with the following expression:

> *Jack of all trades, master of none,* <br>
> *Certainly better than a master of one.*

**Fun fact**: This figure of speech through the times keeps shifting from positive to negative.
"Jack of all trades" - Ambiguous.
"Master of none" - According to wikipedia was added later.
"Certainly better than a master of one" - Recovers the flattering.

Anyway, for all I care, it is by bringing together different areas that new ones are created.
In sum I'm making a fuss because I don't feel satisfied by being either just a dev or just a manager.

So, here you go:

1. Developer
2. Manager
3. Speaker
4. Entrepreneur

I certainly owe it to [**Young Minho Enterprise**](http://yme.pt){:target="_blank"} for the second, to [**CeSIUM**](http://cesium.di.uminho.pt){:target="_blank"} for the first and, to both of them, for the third.
Funny though, as an entrepreneur I've do it all, and more!
That's where [**Nutrium**](http://nutrium.io){:target="_blank"} comes in.

All in all, I find it hard to decline a challenge where I can grow.
What is there to lose?
