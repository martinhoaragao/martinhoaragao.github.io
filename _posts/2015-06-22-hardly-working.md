Hardly Working

As of right now, I'm focusing on cleaning up the code to what I need.

Meanwhile, I'm building up my first post. As soon as it is done, this shall be replaced.

But don't stop coming here just because of that! I shall be as swift as the wind, although I'm neither saying there is wind, nor that it is fast as of right now, you should check the weather forecast.
Oh, I'm so funny. . .
