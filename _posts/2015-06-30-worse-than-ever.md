Building on [Will Koehler's post](http://willkoehler.net/2014/08/26/save-50-hours-setting-up-your-jekyll-blog.html), I've taken the long way.
By that, I mean I chose to personalise my blog, after all it's an opportunity to get to know not only Jekyll, but also SEO and Javascript, it is where I intend to test out new things.
So, after kinda like a robot myself, I settled on the amazing [HMFAYSAL Omega Theme](http://www.hossainmohdfaysal.com/hmfaysal-omega-theme/) yet, despite the amazing design, which I could never reach by myself, the code seemed messier than my own. Though thanks to that, I get to refactor a project!

Here is the progress so far:

+ Update to new version
  + Font Awesome
  + Bootstrap
+ Simplify to Minimal style
  + Navbar
  + Footer
+ Remove Categories
+ Fix 404 Error page
+ Add rake deploy by command
+ Add minify and robots.txt
+ Improve search - by tag, quit with esc or mouse outside
+ Create about page

To Do:

+ Finish splitting into assets pipeline
  + Sass by sections
  + JS in separate files
+ Fix data Errors
+ Evaluate minimal design changes
+ Check cross browser
+ Clean files
+ Do my first actual post!
+ Other stuff that I forgot
+ Fix rake new post
