It's been almost 3 years since I joined Young Minho Enterprise.
Back then, in 2013, I had just arrived at Minho University in order to learn Software Engineering.
Truth be tould, I had absolutely no idea what my degree was all about.
In fact, I had neither programmed nor knew what it was like.
However, it was a sweet surprise when I understood what I would be doing for at least the next three years.
I could go on about why I chose Software Engineering in the first place, but that is off the point.

Yet there was a feeling that I just couldn't shake off.
A lot of what I had practiced thus far would go to waste!
Public speaking, debating, music and acting were some of the skills that I had entwined recently.
Not to mention that despite having had 12 years of education, only part had been about the subjects required for my degree.
For that reason right off the bat I wanted to be a part of something, to learn more, to do more, to make the most of what some call the best time of their lives.
My life.

It was not hard to find a few alternatives, but none came across as what I needed.

+ "Praxe" -
I suppose hazing would be the translation but it is seems harsher than what it is.
Despite that, within the first 5 minutes I knew that it wasn't for me.
Just a few minutes where, as I looked down, I envisioned all the things I could be doing instead of that.
+ Choirs and [Tunas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuna_(music)) - 5 years of my life had been in music and had been more than enough.
It was also just a subset of what I wanted.
+ Newspapers - While it seemed fairly interesting, it demanded writing articles and I, thus far, have been scarcely praised for that.
It is also quite clear that I do not enjoy writing all that much, even these blog posts take ages even though half of the content is in bullet points.
+ Radios and TV - No, thank you.

So, after all, what was it that I required?
What made my blood boil?
It is not like I could recognize a nice journey from a brochure, but I had been learning how to be a leader, how to conquer my shyness, and when to take risks.
I did not what to throw any of it away, not yet, when it was imperative to raise it further.

As a matter of curiosity, we are all introduced to these options when as soon we enroll whether we want to or not.
That's why, when one day, I saw this poster of two  disney dogs, with a slogan similar to this:

![YME Recruiting]({{ site.url }}/images/posts/yme-recruitment.jpg)

> *Dynamic Junior enterprise looking for* <br>
> *dedicated and ambitious students for a serious relationship*
> <small><cite title="Young Minho Enterprise">Recruitment at Young Minho Enterprise</cite></small>

I smirked.

It was bold, captivating and original
Not long afterwards, I applied for it.
That's how, in November, I joined a junior initiative.
Indeed, an initiative, not an enterprise, it still wasn't part of [JADE Portugal](http://jadeportugal.com)) as a fully blown junior enterprise.
It would come soon, and I would be in the front row.

#### **Human Resources**

To many, the contrast between the professionalism during recruitment and the environment in the team caused confusion.
However, I had jumped in with no expectations whatsoever.
It was a blank page, an opportunity, or several of them.
I had the time, the dedication and the creativity.
Marveled as I was, I tried to contribute in any way I could.

The following 6 months and parallel to my first steps as a wannabe developer:
I got to be a part of the Human Resources department, revamping and applying an evaluation process based on 360-degree feedback;
Join the *Breakfasts@Enterprises* team and visit some of the most important enterprises in Braga;
Learn about entrepreneurship on a project sponsored by a city council where we helped teams get from idea to pitch through the Business Model Canvas.

Above all, working with students from all sort of fields, with different backgrounds and each with their own aspirations.

All of this was only possible because of some incredible people that lead the way. They guided people such as myself, to find their own paths.

During that time my goals were:

+ Challenge myself;
+ See the results of my effort;
+ Get to know more people;
+ Gain new skills.

As a sum up, I learnt the importance of real collaboration.

#### **Presidency**

One day, at a meeting, we were tould that a national junior entrepreneur conference would be held in the following week.
It was called Jenial 2014, and I decided to go to one of the three days.
I did not know what to expect so I chose not to commit the entire weekend, the president represented the enterprise the whole conference, while I went with the vice-president.
By then, everyone knew that both of them would resign yet, beyond that, I think no one put more than a fleeting thought to it.

Perhaps I was naive, but it did spark my interest.
Who would be the next leading the path?
Would it bring many changes?
Could it become any better?
Or perhaps it would be catastrophic?

When we arrived the scheduled had been delayed.
So we waited, and I was eager for my first experience in the junior entrepreneur network.
So I could not stop thinking about YME, out of curiosity I asked the vice-president with no other intention other than to break the silence, who would replace them?

"Why not you?"

Well I had never thought of it, at all, really.
Why not me indeed, why me, Y ME.
Ah, see what I did there?
By the way, that is indeed how we spell it.

But then I did, weighted all the options, during the following two hours or so, my brain boiled.
In my mind the reasons as to why I was not suited kept growing, but somehow it did not worry me too much.

It is not like I had a lot of time to think about it, not long after I was being introduced to several other junior entrepreneurs, presidents, directors, founders.
The day before we had officially been accepted as a junior enterprise, or was it that very same day?
Details get fuzzy, I had "Why not you?" ringing on my head, but I kept pushing to the backburner.
The time was to absorb everything that I could, so that I would be able to process it afterwards.
A window had opened, was I sure it was not just unlocked.
Could I, no, was I read to peek into it?
Or should I just dive right through?

Regardless, I couldn't do it alone.
Presidency was a two persons job.
Who did I trust to go join this adventure?
Failing in finding someone would be the same as not being ready to take on the responsability.
But the people I knew either were not ready for it, or I felt that together we wouldn't have the vigour that the predecessors had.

Lets rewind, I joined a junior initiative, that had just been upgraded into a junior enterprise.
Well, I had helped prepare the documents that were required for the this to happen along with someone.
She had just replaced the Director of the Communication Department.
Although we had only worked once, we were the only ones who were called to an urgent and important project.

The network expected more and more from us.

Chronologically, we worked together at the start of March, by the end of March the "Y not me" question popped up.
During the start of May I had to take action, so I contacted her.



Later I was tould that all of it had been prepared months before.

It's been a nice journey indeed.
